pycatechism - A frontend for Jeffrey Pinyan's (@PrayingTheMass) catechism API
Author: Chase (@ckcathcart/@marleyblakedog)
Git repo: https://github.com/marleyblakedog/pycatechism

..admonition: This is an early preview. This library and the API itself may
              both change substantially at any time without advance warning.

Getting Started:
    from catechism import Catechism
    c = Catechism('your_email', 'api_key')
    c.sections.list()

Check out the docstrings for more info, but that's pretty much all there is to it.
